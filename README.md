# Carry-Lookahead-Adder
Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA)
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA), a high-speed adder that improves upon the traditional ripple carry adder by reducing carry propagation delay. The CLA is a critical component in modern digital systems where fast arithmetic operations are required.

Overview
A Carry Lookahead Adder is a combinational circuit designed to add two binary numbers with minimal propagation delay. Instead of waiting for carries to ripple through each bit, the CLA uses generate and propagate logic to compute carry signals in parallel, significantly speeding up addition operations.

Key Concepts:
Generate Signal (G): Indicates that a bit position will generate a carry regardless of the input carry.
Propagate Signal (P): Indicates that a bit position will propagate a carry if an input carry exists.
